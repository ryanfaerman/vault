Vault - The non-database
===

Vault is a barely structured memory storage. It provides a thread-safe wrapper around a basic map and the ability to dump/restore the map to whatever persistent storage you prefer.

I wrote this because databases are annoying and I like waiting until the last second to pick one.

## Install

```
go get github.com/ryanfaerman/vault
